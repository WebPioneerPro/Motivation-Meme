# Motivation Meme

Welcome to the "Motivation Meme" project! In this project, we've created a motivational post website, stylized to inspire and motivate. The project includes various CSS properties to enhance the visual appeal and deliver a message of positivity.

## Project Description

The "Motivation Meme" project is a simple website designed to provide a motivational message using a meme-style format. It incorporates the following features:

1. Utilizes the "Libre Baskerville" font from Google Fonts for the main h1 text.
   - Google Fonts Link: [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville)

2. White text on a black background for high contrast.

3. An image with a 5px white border is added to the page. The image is located in the "assets/images" folder.

4. The h1 text is center-aligned to enhance readability.

5. A div is used to contain the h1, p, and img elements. Margins are adjusted to ensure the image and text are centered on the page. The image is set to have a width of 100% to fill the div.

6. The text-transform property is applied to the h1 to make it uppercase.

Feel free to modify and customize this project according to your preferences and requirements.
